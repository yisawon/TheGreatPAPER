- CSI300E

### Selected Stock
- The selected stocks in CSI100E and CSI300E can be found at ./data/raw_data/100E/stocks.txt and ./data/raw_data/300E/stocks.txt,respectively
 
### Raw Transcational Data
- Due to The raw transcational data are about 1.1Gb and the limited space, a small part of the data is given. more data and preprocess code will be released soon.

- A part of transcational data can be found at ./data/raw_data/100E/historical price.xlsx and ./data/raw_data/300E/historical price.xlsx.

- Due to the limited space and raw news data are about 2.3Gb, a small part of the data is given. more data and preprocess code will be released soon.

- The intra-class relations can be found at ./data/raw_data/100E/intra-class and ./data/raw_data/300E/intra-class.

###Due to memory limit, the system prompts that there is an error with the network and the file could not be uploaded.  We only listed a small part of the data, and our newly constructed benchmark datasets (CSI100E and CSI300E) will be released on Github(ï¼šhttps://github.com/[Anonymous]/DANSMP) if accepted
